"fine-tuned" is a game set in a future apocalypse where humanity's hubris has led us to abandon life of Earth and colonize Mars. Why leave Earth? Because it has been turned into a giant data center, dedicated to running ChatGPT. Many such horrors await, in fine-tuned, an educational game about responsible, ethical technology, and balancing human creativity with innovative endeavors. With a technical premise, fine-tuned is a rhythm game that guides the player through reinvigorating engineers' passion for the arts. Made in 24 hours for Cornhacks 2025.
