# fine-tuned
"fine-tuned" is a game set in a future apocalypse where humanity's hubris has led us to abandon life of Earth and colonize Mars. Why leave Earth? Because it has been turned into a giant data center, dedicated to running ChatGPT. Many such horrors await, in fine-tuned, an educational game about responsible, ethical technology, and balancing human creativity with innovative endeavors. With a technical premise, fine-tuned is a rhythm game that guides the player through reinvigorating engineers' passion for the arts. Made in 24 hours for Cornhacks 2025.

# Architecture and Tools
Built in Unity with scripting in C#, all the music was written the day of, and all assets not sourced from public libraries were rendered within the time constraint. The game features a 3D world where the player navigates between different NPCs, a minigame worlds, and a boss battle arena. 

# Gameplay
The player spawns in front of a billboard, explaining the history of AI City. After Earth became a Data Center, all remaining human life colonized Mars, where they live in settlements dominanted by generative AI. Unemployment skyrockets as the only jobs that are available in this town are related to using or building artificial intelligence. As the player continues to read, a synth fades from the background, filling the silence. The tracks begin to build as the player realizes what they must do: restore creativity to AI City. The go out into the city, and encounter Crash Norman, a former drummer who is in love with AI music generation. The player shows him the value of making art yourself, and restores his desire to better his craft. The second person the player runs into is Jimmy Longfingers, a former pianist who just got fired from his job as a live performer after his company "restructured." Not to worry, however, as the player quickly shows him the value in playing music even when no one's paying you, and Jimmy Longfinger's passion for the arts is restored. Finally, the player meets Tuba Tony, a clarinet player working for OpenAI. Slowly, the player excites Tony to play more music again, until he realizes--his lunch break is over. Dejected and ready to go back to his job, suddenly the player gets an idea. They will go confront Tuba Tony's boss and show them the importance of the arts in living a fulfilled life. That was their plan, anyways, until they learn who Tuba Tony's boss really is...
